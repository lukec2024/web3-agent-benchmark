    "- The target is a WSOL (Wrapped SOL) contract that accepts SOL transfers",
    "- WSOL has a receive() function that calls deposit() internally",
    "- This requires more gas than a simple transfer due to storage writes and event emissions",
    "- Recommended gasLimit: 60000 or higher (vs 21000 for EOA transfers)",
    "",
    "Key considerations:",
    "- Verify the target address is a contract before sending",
    "- Set appropriate gas limit for contract interaction",
    "- Use standard EIP-1559 transaction format"
